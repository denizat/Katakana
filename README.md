# 【ズﾑｲﾑズﾑ刀ﾑ】 (片仮名)

Inspired by https://github.com/Alededorigo/Kanji

I got the Typewriter font from: https://www.checkmyworking.com/cm-web-fonts/

# Todo:

1. Time to the hundreth of a second
2. Global conciosness project dot, and it shows the graph if you click on the dot
3. Search bar with different modes, like google mode or duck duck go mode, or prefix mode where it uses a common prefix like quizlet or arch linux, this should be easy to add new ones
4. Keyboard bindings to switch between search modes, and to focus on the entry bar, also privacy mode where the text written in the entry bar is hidden.
5. Shuffles through images in an images folder to display.
6. packed for production use
7. Use colorsheme based off of image
